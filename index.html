  <h1>Detect Canvas Noise</h1>
  <p>Some canvas noise / blocking tools claim they cannot be detected by website. Is it true?</p>
  <p>The detector here is simple: We try to draw canvas with solid colors, and then read pixels on the canvas. Every pixels on the canvas should be the expected color if no canvas noise tools installed.</p>
  <p>Is canvas noise enabled? <span id="final">Running...</span></p>

  <noscript>JavaScript not enabled. No canvas should work.</noscript>
