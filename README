Detect Canvas Noise

Some canvas noise / blocking tools claim they cannot be detected by website. Is it true?

The detector here is simple: We try to draw canvas with solid colors, and then read pixels on the canvas. Every pixels on the canvas should be the expected color if no canvas noise tools installed.
